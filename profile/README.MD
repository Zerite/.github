# Hey, we're Zerite! ðŸ‘‹

We're a passionate team of developers working on numerous innovations in the gaming space.
Our goal is to make scalable and easy to use tools for the developer community.
**Let's cut out the time and effort to find the right tool for the job, together!**

### ðŸ’» Projects

Many of our projects are open source and can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Zerite).
Here are some of our most popular projects:

* [CraftLib](https://github.com/Zerite/CraftLib) - A wrapper for all things Minecraft (supports 1.7.x - 1.8.x). *Protocol, NBT, chat, schematics, etc.*
* [Multifold](https://github.com/MultifoldLauncher) - A next-generation cross-platform Minecraft Launcher.

### ðŸ‘‹ Hiya.gg

Currently, we're working on [Hiya.gg](https://hiya.gg) - a social platform to help your followers and fans find more places and ways to support you.
Discoverability is a **huge** issue in the industry, and we're working to eliminate the clutter, cut the BS, and help connect people, together.

**Open Source**

Projects we believe are in a ready state to be open source are listed below.

* [Landing Page](https://github.com/Zerite/hiyagg-landing) - Our landing page while our "professional engineering monkeys" are hard at work.

**Closed Source (Currently)**

Though some components are closed source currently, we're working hard to get them into a ready state for open source.
We believe in community support, and we're working to keep transparency at a core in our development process.

* [Backend](https://github.com/Zerite/hiyagg-backend) - The backend API, handling accounts, connections, and other data.
